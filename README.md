# Hi, I'm Vinay 👋

I'm an AIML student working on Python fundamentals, data structures, and hands-on machine learning projects.

## What I'm doing now
- Daily coding practice (Python, DSA)
- Building small mini-projects to sharpen fundamentals
- Preparing for AIML workflows like data cleaning, text processing, and later ML models
- Documenting everything publicly through GitHub

## Current Focus
- Python fundamentals
- NumPy and Pandas
- Mini NLP and data projects
- GitHub discipline and clean repo structure
